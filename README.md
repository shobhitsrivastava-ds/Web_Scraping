***What is web scraping ?***

Web Scraping (also termed Screen Scraping, Web Data Extraction, Web Harvesting etc.) is a technique employed to extract large amounts of data from websites whereby the data is extracted and saved to a local file in your computer or to a database in table (spreadsheet) format.

Data displayed by most websites can only be viewed using a web browser. They do not offer the functionality to save a copy of this data for personal use. The only option then is to manually copy and paste the data - a very tedious job which can take many hours or sometimes days to complete. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process, so that instead of manually copying the data from websites, the Web Scraping software will perform the same task within a fraction of the time. 

A web scraping software will automatically load and extract data from multiple pages of websites based on your requirement. It is either custom built for a specific website or is one which can be configured to work with any website. With the click of a button you can easily save the data available in the website to a file in your computer.

The problem with most generic web scraping software is that they are very difficult to setup and use. There is a steep learning curve involved. WebHarvy was designed to solve this problem. With a very intuitive, point and click interface, using WebHarvy you can start extracting data within minutes from any website.

Please watch the following demonstration which shows how easy it is to configure and use WebHarvy for your data extraction needs. 

Web scraping is essentially a form of data mining. Items like weather reports, auction details, market pricing, or any other list of collected data can be sought in Web scraping efforts.

The practice of Web scraping has drawn a lot of controversy because the terms of use for some websites do not allow certain kinds of data mining. Despite the legal challenges, Web scraping promises to become a popular way of collecting information as these kinds of aggregated data resources become more capable.
